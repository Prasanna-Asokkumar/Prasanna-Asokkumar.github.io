Skype was officially discontinued in May 2025 having been an innovator in the communications and video calling space in the 2000s. As an avid user of Skype in my teenage years and having used a mix of both Skype and Zoom while working at NatWest on client site, I was curious to delve into the data behind the fortunes of both platforms/companies and conducted research into reasons why Skype stagnated & fell behind after failing to adapt and innovate (despite being the original pioneer). I compared and contrasted this to Zoom who conversely succeeded in becoming the industry leader. 

I found data online pertaining to the journeys that both companies took, looking at multiple metrics such as user numbers, revenues, meeting minutes, market shares and worldwide 'interest' changes over time, before making visualisations (using Microsoft Excel & Microsoft Power BI) to demonstrate the respective rises of Skype and Zoom along with how their positions changed after the COVID pandemic hit. To fully consolidate my findings, I justified my data and visualisations through the research I undertook on the journeys that both companies had to explain the trends I saw from the data I collected about the two companies. This was coupled with recommendations based around the idea of maintaining business resilience through effective innovation and adaptation, using the contrasting fortunes of both companies as reference points.
